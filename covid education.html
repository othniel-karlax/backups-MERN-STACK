        <p><H4>Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. <BR>In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.</H4></p>
            <H3><p class="othniel">ORIGIN OF COVID 19</p></H3>
            <P><H4>The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China.<BR> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event.<BR> Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market,<BR>it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market.<BR> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, <BR>which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections </H4></P>
